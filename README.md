# RaceTimer (group5) - project for EDAF45

### This is a project that me and 9 others built whilst taking the course EDAF45 at LTH.The premise is to build an application that supports recording times for different kinds of races. 

### Our group produced one of the most advanced applications out of all participants, with a fully fledged web application that runs Java / Node / Express on the backend and React on the frontend. I contributed the most in terms of lines of code, 2nd most in terms of commits to the repository and played an integral part in all of the components of the project. I also imposed a new architecture for all the Java code which resulted in us progressing very rapidly.
